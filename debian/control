Description: Run travis-ci builds locally using Docker
 travis-run creates virtual machines resembling the build environment provided
 by the travis-ci.org continuous integration service. This is so one can run and
 debug builds locally, which should take most of the guesswork out of fixing
 problems that only occur on travis-ci but not on the developer's machine. To do
 this, we use the same chef-solo cookbooks used by travis-ci and generate the
 script to drive the build from the .travis.yml file using the ruby libraries
 published by them.
