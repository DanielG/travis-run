Changes in 0.2:
	- Add `destroy` command to delete all docker images created by
	travis-run.

	- Add support for pulling pre-built images from the docker hub,
	this is now the default.

	- Cleanup old docker container before starting a new one.

	- Reuse running and stopped containers.

	- Add explicit boot2docker support +workarounds.

	- Add `--shell` option to `run` command, just drops into a shell
	without running the build.

	- Don't use `~/.travis-run/*/` for docker contexts anymore, now
	using a tmp-dir.

	- Save environment after build and restore it when dropping into a
	shell.

	- Lots and lots of fixes.
