Virtualization backend to use. Currently available backends
(defaults to: docker):
.IP
\- docker
.HP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keep\fR
.IP
Don't stop and destroy VM after build finishes. This is useful
during development as you will only have to go through
VM creation once. Make sure to `travis\-run clean' or
`travis\-run stop' after you're done with the VM.
.HP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-vm\-name\fR=\fI\,VM_NAME\/\fR
.IP
Arbitrary identifier associated with the build VM. (defaults
to: travis\-run\-vm). The backend may support persistent options
per VM referenced by name, see backend documentation for
details.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS "run [BUILD_ID | BUILD_CONFIG]:"
.IP
(default if no command given)
Run the build matrix in sequence and abort on the first failure or run
the given BUILD_ID (see the `matrix' command). On failure you will be
dropped into a shell inside the build environment so you can figure
out what's going on.
.SS "stop:"
.IP
Stop running build VM. This will tear down the VM as well as all it's
disk state.
.SS "create:"
.IP
Setup build VM. Depending on the backend it might be stored globally
or in `.travis\-run' in the current directory.
.TP
\fB\-\-docker\-base\-image\fR=\fI\,BASE_IMAGE\/\fR
Docker image to use as the base for the container, see
`FROM' Dockerfile command.  (defaults to:
ubuntu:presice)
.TP
\fB\-\-docker\-build\-stage\fR=\fI\,STAGE\/\fR
Stage of the image build to run, (one of: base,
script, language, project)
.SS "clean:"
.IP
Stop running build VM, and clean any backend specific state kept in
the project directory.
.SS "matrix:"
.IP
Print the build matrix. The number in the first column is the
BUILD_ID. The part after the ':' is the BUILD_CONFIG, note that this
is whitespace sensitive.
