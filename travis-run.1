(defaults to: docker):
.IP
\- docker
.HP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-keep\fR
.IP
Don't stop and destroy VM after build finishes. This is useful
during development as you will only have to go through
VM creation once. Make sure to `travis\-run clean' or
`travis\-run stop' after you're done with the VM.
.HP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-vm\-name\fR=\fI\,VM_NAME\/\fR
.IP
Arbitrary identifier associated with the build VM. (defaults
to: travis\-run\-vm). The backend may support persistent options
per VM referenced by name, see backend documentation for
details.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS "run (default if no command given):"
.IP
Run the build matrix in sequence and abort on the first failure
dropping into a shell for diagnostics by default. Note that by
default the project directory is also synchronized with the VM running
the build before and after the build so make sure your .travis.yml
contains a `clean' action before attempting the build.
.SS "stop:"
.IP
Stop running build VM. This will tear down the VM as well as\e all it's
disk state.
.SS "create:"
.IP
Setup build VM. Depending on the backend it might be stored globally
or in `.travis\-run' in the current directory.
.TP
\fB\-\-docker\-base\-image\fR=\fI\,BASE_IMAGE\/\fR
Docker image to use as the base for the container, see
`FROM' Dockerfile command.  (defaults to:
ubuntu:presice)
.TP
\fB\-\-docker\-build\-stage\fR=\fI\,STAGE\/\fR
Stage of the image build to run, (one of: base,
script, language, project)
.SS "clean:"
.IP
Stop running build VM, and clean any backend specific state kept in
the project directory.
